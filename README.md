# Tetrad
Blades-style UI

Tetrad is a UI based off of JX720, which is a long defunct skin made for XBMC (XBMC was renamed to Kodi years ago). I hope to port it down the chain of XBMC releases until Tetrad supports modern Kodi builds.
Besides a few small cosmetic tweaks the project should stay relatively unchanged visually and functionally and just get needed updates to further port it down the chain.
When Tetrad matures to the point of supporting modern Kodi builds then thats when the creativity can flow. I envision this UI to be more like the old X360 blades UI with animations that better mimic the X360, including its iconic sounds.
