TetradUI for Kodi
=====================================

About TetradUI
==============

TetradUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi media center, a open-source application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with TetradUI is to create a fresh modern homage of the classic blades-style UI found in the original Xbox360 dashboard. Also seen in the works of Team Blackbolt and Jezz_X with projects MC360 and JX720 respectively. TetradUI is based from JX720 by Jezz_X.

==================

Special thanks to Team Kodi for continuing to develop the greatest software ever made! 
Big thanks to Gade for all the work he's done for TeamUI as lead developer on TetradUI. TetradUI was born from a unique collaborative effort by TeamUI and was forked from the JX720 project by Jezz_X.
Thanks to Team Blackbolt for the work you've all done in the past for the skinning community including the creation of MC360.
