TetradUI for Kodi
=====================================

About TetradUI
==============

TetradUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi media center, a open-source application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with TetradUI is to resurrect the classic blades-style user interface found in the original Xbox360 dashboard. 
Also found in the works of Team Blackbolt and Jezz_X with projects MC360 and JX720 respectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install and use TetradUI using Kodi:
====================================

Copy the 'skin.tetradui' folder that is found in the zip file to your Kodi/addons/ directory.
This folder may be different depending where you installed to. When you have copied it
over go to the Appearance Options and in the Skin selection window, choose TetradUI.

You may also install direct from within Kodi's addon manager.

-------------------------------------------------
Upgrading previous TeetradUI versions to a newer one:
=================================================

Do NOT overwrite TetradUI, many files change and leaving old files will result in adverse
effects. Make sure you fully delete your TetradUI folder from Kodi/addons/ and then overwrite with
the new one found in this zip file.

Special Thanks:
==================

Team Kodi for continuing to develop the greatest software ever made!
Jezz_X for the original work done on JX720. 
Blackbolt for all the graphics work you've done, whether it gets overhauled and replaced or whatever it doesn't matter. You started this journey for me many years ago 
with the work you did with Team Blackbolt when you created MC360. Whatever you are doing wherever you are, may peace be with you brother.
